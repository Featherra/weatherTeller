# Weather App

## Welcome to my first project
Well, I've made some little ones a long the way, but not a big project. 
<br>It's not finished *yet*, there are still more things I need to change/make better.
<br> But I'm already excited about the way it turned out!

With the little animations and gifs, It's really brought to life.
<br> And.. as I've said already, It's not finished. I still have so many ideas for this project.

### Curious?
* Day/Night theme
<br> This is going to check whether It's day or night for you. 
<br>Dark mode theme/gifs for when it's nighttime and ofcourse same goes for light mode/daytime.
* Adding falling raindrops if it's raining, which fall all over the body. 
<br> Making it rain all over your screen!
* Creating a better system for the weather sprites (the pixel images)
<br> Right now, I've just snatched src urls from gifs I thought were perfect through inspector.
<br> This Isn't the most secure way to do it, cause If google deletes that certain img/gif, It's gone for me as well.
* Responsiveness using @media
<br> I think this one is pretty straightforward, this will most likely take a lot of time but I'll learn a lot from it.
<br> I want to become better at responsiveness and at understanding it. So, perfect learning curve right?

## Untill then...
Even though it's not finished yet, It's got the main point ready and set to take a peek at.
<br> Enjoy my weather app!
